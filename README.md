# VCF of polymorphic sites from **Pica** sp. samples inferred by ddRAD sequencing

SNP dataset for the manuscript "**Introgression at the emerging secondary contact zone of magpie Pica pica subspecies (Aves: Corvidae): integrating data on nuclear and mitochondrial markers, vocalizations and field observations**".

Meta-information for each sample in the VCF file [populations.snps_filtered.vcf.gz](/data/populations.snps_filtered.vcf.gz), which contains polymorphic sites from ddRAD seqencing, can found in the corresponding Excel Table [SampleSheet_Plate_Pica_20180704.xlsx](/data/SampleSheet_Plate_Pica_20180704.xlsx).

Information on the sequencing protocol, the ddRAD library preparation and bioinformatic analyses can be found in the document [ddRAD_README.pdf)](/data/ddRAD_README.pdf).
